Telephone Communication System Simulation 


Project Description: 
This project is based on simulation of telecommunication systems. 
Our main objective is to simulate a given number of calls and determine what proportions are successfully transmitted, unsuccessful or blocked, and no of busy calls. 


Objective: 
-- The system has a number of telephones connected to a switchboard by lines.
-- The switchboard has a number of links which can be used to connect any two lines, Call sender and call receiver. Subject to the condition that only one connection at a time can     be made to each line. 
-- The server can establish a maximum of 3 connections at a time. 
-- If a call is already engaged with another call and a third person tries to connect, then it will be a busy call.
-- If a call lost to connect or no link is available, then it will be a lost connection and count as a block call. 
-- We can connect 6 lines at a time though we have 8 telephones. 

Attribute: 
Each call is a separate entity having attributes
a) Source
b) Destination
c) Length, and
d) Ending time
